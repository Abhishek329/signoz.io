Kubernetes is complex, as **[accepted by Google itself](https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/google_kubernetes_autopilot/)**. If you need more proof, here is an interesting collection of **[Kubernetes failure stories](https://k8s.af/)**. But Kubernetes is also a powerful container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized application. So the way forward is to make Kubernetes easier.

Kube-bench can be used to check whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the [CIS Kubernetes benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/). CIS benchmarks are best practices for the secure configuration of a target system. Kube-bench implements CIS benchmarks as closely as possible.

Tests can be configured with YAML files making it easy to update as test specifications evolve.

### Project Quay

Quay can be used to build, store and distribute your applications and containers. Its container image registries let you store container images in a central location.

Regular users of Project Quay can create repositories to organize their images and add read and write access to the repositories that users control.

Admin users can perform a broader set of tasks, such as the ability to add users and control default settings.

[![project quay](/img/learn/2021/11/quay.webp)](https://github.com/quay/quay)

### Kube-applier

Kube-applier enables continuous deployment of Kubernetes objects by applying declarative configuration files from a Git repository to a Kubernetes cluster.

It runs as a Pod in a Kubernetes cluster and watches the Git repo to ensure that the cluster objects are up-to-date with their associated spec files (JSON or YAML) in the repo.

[![project quay](/img/learn/2021/11/kube-applier.webp)](https://github.com/box/kube-applier)

### Kubetail

Kubetail enables you to aggregate logs from multiple pods into one stream. It is same as running `kubectl logs -f` but for multiple pods. Getting logs from multiple pods is often required and that's where Kubetail helps developers.

Kubetail is a simple bash script that allows you to tail multiple pods simultaneously in an easy manner.

[![Kubetail](/img/learn/2021/11/kubetail.webp)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail)

### Kube-state-metrics

Kube-state-metrics enables you to get metrics based on the current state of Kubernetes native resources. It is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects. A few example metrics captured by kube-state-metrics are:

- `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total`
- `kube_deployment_status_replicas`
- `kube_pod_container_resource_requests`
- `kube_pod_container_resource_limits`

Hope you enjoyed the list. We are currently building [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) - an open-source full-stack APM. It can be used for metrics, logs and distributed tracing in a single pane of glass. SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry for code instrumentation, which is quietly becoming the world standard for generating telemetry data.
