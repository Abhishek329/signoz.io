# Upgrade to 0.8.0

v0.8.0 is a breaking release which requires data migration, if you are upgrading from an older version then you have to run the data migration scripts to be able to see past data.

### First upgrade to 0.8.0

- `git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git && cd signoz/deploy/`
- `git checkout v0.8.0`
- `./install.sh`

The past data wonâ€™t be visible on the new application until you run the migration script.

### Steps to run migration script:

### Docker

```bash
docker run --name signoz_migrate --network clickhouse-setup_default \
  -it -d signoz/migrate:0.8 -host=clickhouse -port=9000
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f signoz_migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the container before running the migration script again.

```bash
docker stop signoz_migrate

docker rm signoz_migrate
```

### Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl -n platform run -i -t signoz-migrate --image=signoz/migrate:0.8 \
  -- -host=my-release-clickhouse -port=9000 -userName=admin -password=27ff0399-0d3a-4bd8-919d-17c2181e6fb9
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
kubectl -n platform logs -f signoz_migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the pod before running the migration script again.

```bash
kubectl -n platform delete pod signoz_migrate
```
