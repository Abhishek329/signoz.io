SigNoz supports OpenTelemetry natively for instrumentation.

## Sample .NET applicationâ€‹

- For instrumenting your .NET applications, please check the official [OpenTelemetry .NET repo.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet)

- Here's a sample project with example for instrumenting ASP.net CORE app and sending data to SigNoz - [ASP.net CORE App SigNoz repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-ASPNETCore-app)


Feel free to use this repo to test out OpenTelemetry instrumentation and how to send telemetry data to SigNoz.
