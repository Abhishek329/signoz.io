We are yet to create an official guide for Ruby instrumentation, but [this blog](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-ruby/) should help you get started.


Here's another <a href = "https://medium.com/@leunardus.vederis714/monitor-your-ruby-on-rails-app-using-signoz-opentelemetry-b59578f3b252" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >detailed guide</a> published by our community member Vederis on how to monitor your Ruby on Rails application with OpenTelemetry and SigNoz.

We will add more detailed docs here soon. Stay tuned!
