OpenTelemetry is a vendor-agnostic instrumentation library. In this article, let's explore how you can auto-instrument your Java Spring Boot application with OpenTelemetry and get the data reported through SigNoz - an open-source APM and observability tool.
Steps to get started with OpenTelemetry for Spring Boot application
Installing SigNoz
Installing sample Spring Boot app

Installing SigNoz
You can get started with SigNoz using just three commands at your terminal if you have Docker installed. You can read about other deployment options from SigNoz documentation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
```

You will have an option to choose between ClickHouse or Kafka + Druid as a storage option. Trying out SigNoz with ClickHouse database takes less than 1.5GB of memory, and for this tutorial, we will use that option.
When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at: http://localhost:3000
The application list shown in the dashboard is from a sample app called HOT R.O.D that comes bundled with the SigNoz installation package.

</div>

Installing sample Spring Boot app

Steps to get the app set up and running:1. Git clone the repository and go to the root folder

2. Update portThis app runs on port 8080 by default. But port 8080 is used by SigNoz for its query service, so let's update the port number to something else.
Open the application.properties file located at spring-petclinic/src/main/resources and update the server.port attribute.

Also, update the port number in petclinic_test_plan.jmx located at spring-petclinic/src/test/jmeter to port number: 8090. It will appear under PETCLINIC_PORT elementProp.
3. Run the applicationRun the application using the following commands.

You can now access the application UI here: http://localhost:8090/ 

Once you ensure that your application runs fine, stop it with ctrl + z on mac, as we will be launching the application with the Java agent downloaded from OpenTelemetry.
Auto instrumentation with OpenTelemetry and sending data to SigNoz

Download the latest Java JAR agent.
Now you need to enable the instrumentation agent as well as run your sample application. You can do so by the following command:

As you are running this on your local host, you need to replace with localhost. The path should be updated to where you have kept your downloaded Java JAR agent. Your final command will look like this:

Check out the Spring Pet Clinic app at: http://localhost:8090/ and play around with it to generate some load. It might take 1-2 minutes before it starts showing up in the SigNoz dashboard.
Below you can find your javaApp in the list of applications being monitored.

Metrics and Traces of the Spring Boot application
SigNoz makes it easy to visualize metrics and traces captured through OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
SigNoz comes with out of box RED metrics charts and visualization. RED metrics stands for:
Rate of requests
Error rate of requests
Duration taken by requests 

You can then choose a particular timestamp where latency is high to drill down to traces around that timestamp.

You can use flamegraphs to exactly identify the issue causing the latency.

Conclusion
OpenTelemetry makes it very convenient to instrument your Spring Boot application. You can then use an open-source APM tool like SigNoz to analyze the performance of your app. As SigNoz offers a full-stack observability tool, you don't have to use multiple tools for your monitoring needs.
You can try out SigNoz by visiting its GitHub repo ðŸ‘‡
