## SigNoz

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article) is full-stack open-source application monitoring and observability tool which can be a great DataDog alternative. It can be hosted within your infra, and as such, you don't need to send your data to a third-party vendor. It uses distributed tracing to help developers gauge the performance of their application in production. It captures both metrics and traces with log management currently in the product roadmap.
A few things that SigNoz can help you with as a DataDog alternative are:

- Track the popular RED metrics
  - Rate of user requests
  - Error rate in user requests
  - Duration taken to complete user requests
- p99, p95 & p50 latencies for your application
- External API calls, Database calls, and top endpoints
- Track transactions across different microservices using distributed tracing

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry - a vendor-agnostic instrumentation library for generating telemetry data. OpenTelemetry is a project under Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is becoming the industry standard for creating portable telemetry data.

## Prometheus

<a href = "https://prometheus.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a>Â can serve as a DataDog alternative if you are looking to track only metrics for your applications. It was initially developed at SoundCloud in 2012 before being released as an open-source project. It was the second project to graduate from CNCF after Kubernetes. If you want to opt for an open-source tool for metrics monitoring, then Prometheus can be a good option.

It enables you to capture time-series data as metrics. It's a pull-based monitoring system where the Prometheus server pulls metrics from exporters known as Prometheus targets. Other components in the Prometheus architecture include:

- A query language known as PromQL is used to query collected time-series data
- In-built alert manager which is used for managing notifications and silencing
- Visualization layer, which includes a built-in expression browser

The visualization layer of Prometheus is basic, and it is often used alongside Grafana, an open-source analytics, and visualization tool.
